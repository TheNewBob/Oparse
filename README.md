# Oparse

A model binding library for Orbiter cfg files.

## Project status

Pretty much finished, awaiting revision of documentation.

## Documentation

Oparse is designed to let you bind values from cfg files to fields in your classes and validate them with as comfortable a syntax as I could manage.
This isn't Jackson however, since C++ isn't Java and doesn't support any kind of reflection, so unfortunately you still have to define the bindings yourself.
